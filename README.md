## 👋 Hi, I’m **Luis Mira**

🎯 **Social Media Manager transitioning into Data Analytics**  
I’m passionate about understanding how people and numbers connect.  

After several years leading digital strategies for brands, I decided to focus on the analytical side — recently completing a **Data Analytics Bootcamp at [Neoland](https://neoland.es/bootcamps/data-analytics/)**, where I worked with **Python, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau**.  

I’m currently exploring projects related to **marketing, music, and user behavior**, applying visualization and storytelling to extract actionable insights.  

💬 *I believe data shouldn’t replace creativity — it should sharpen it.*
