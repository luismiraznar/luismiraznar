## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Luis Mira  

Iâ€™m a **Social Media Manager transitioning into Data Analytics**, passionate about understanding how people and numbers connect.  

After several years leading digital strategies for brands, I decided to focus on the analytical side â€” recently completing a **Data Analytics Bootcamp at Neoland**, where I worked with **Python, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau**.  

Iâ€™m currently exploring data projects related to marketing, music, and user behavior, applying visualization and storytelling to extract actionable insights.  

I believe data should not replace creativity â€” it should sharpen it.  

ðŸ“Š Tools & Skills: Python Â· SQL Â· Power BI Â· Tableau Â· Pandas
